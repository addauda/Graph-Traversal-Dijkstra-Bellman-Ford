Final Project For Algorithms!!!!Programmed By Rammuni De Zoysa, Mohammed Altasan and Ahmed Dauda!!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments:
!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!
Application based on XML file input, so sample XML file provided in folder (network.xml)
Please click "open file" in the menu, navigate to xml file direcctory, and open file
---------------------------------------------------------------------
!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!
>Repetitive connections is not needed e.g --> [toronto chicago 23] does not need a mapping back as [chicago toronto 23],redundant mappings were not tested could produce undesirable results
>Each function has its prerequisites to run properly
  1) Changing the weight on a Node: requires the source,destination and cost
  2) Removing A node: requires only the source city
  3) Removing An edge: requires a source, and a destination
  4) BellMan ford: requires a source city
  5) kruskals: no requirement, button only has to be clicked
  6) Adding a node manually: requires a source,destination and cost
!!!!Please input the values required and then click intended function!!!

Map was completed with the Bing Maps WPF control API
Internet Connection required for mapping feature to work
Map features, ideas and resources are credited to Microsoft Developer Network {http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh750210.aspx}

Future Improvements:
-->Map could be used to display algorithms results
-->links between cities could be modifies by clicking and dragging links on the map
-->support for all type of input files and not just xml
